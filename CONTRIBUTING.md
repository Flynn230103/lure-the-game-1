# Contributing guidelines

Thank you for contributing to Lure! We appreciate every bit of help we can get.

Following these guidelines will help us maintain a smooth workflow, and prevent any unnecessary conflicts. Meaning the game gets finished faster!

We are looking for any contributions to art, music, gameplay, or stability. We would also like to ensure that this game is both a fun game, and a clean codebase.

This repository is not a "playground" - please use a private fork to do any experimentation on. We also hope that you do not use this tracker to discuss the game as a whole. This tracker should be used for bugs and planned features only - we would love to discuss your idea on [Reddit] or [Discord]!

## Behavior

- Private github repositories have full permissions for collaborators, and there is no way to turn them off. Please respect this project and do not abuse them.
- Follow all the rules posted on the other forums.
- Respect other members of our community.

## When you contribute

- Only contribute via pull requests, even if you can merge locally. This allows us to discuss anything you may have missed, or to prevent mishaps that can occur with more complicated merges.
- Ensure that your code is functional before requesting a merge.
- Please try to abide by default VS coding standards ("auto-format").
- Please organize your assets, and keep pull requests as granular as possible (as we will have to manually review them).
- Do not create a pull request without first planning the feature on the Discord. We don't want to have to waste your time.

We will add more to this contributing guide as we gain more insight into what we need to explain. Please let us know if you have any questions or comments about our rules.
